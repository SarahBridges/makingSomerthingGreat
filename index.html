<h1>Visualizations</h1>
<h3>Why is visualization effective?</h3>
<p>According to Cairo, visualization is effective because data can be hard for the human brain to conceptualize raw. 
Visualization can portray data in a way that is more understandble and therefore more truthful for the audience. 
</p>

<h3>What are the more effective ways to encode data for perceptual tasks?</h3>
<p>Cario suggests a good and effecitve way to encode data is a "hierarchy of elementary perceptual tasks." The visualizations 
lower in the hierarchy are effective in enabling audiences to make general estimates about the data, while the visualizations 
higher in the hierarchy are effective in enabling audiences to make accurate estimates about the data presented.
The desired effect you wish for your data to convey to your audience will determine where on the hierarchy a visualization 
should be chosen. For example, if you wish to represent a general patterns about your data, visualizations lower in the 
hierarchy will be more effective, while if you wish to have your audience imfer accuate judgements about your data, 
visualizations higher in the hierarchy will be more effective. Sometimes, you may want to convey both a general pattern and 
enable accurate estimates about your data. In this case, multiple graphics should be used to convey the most effective 
visualizations.
</p>

<h3>What are trade-offs that Cairo asks us to consider when building a visualization?</h3>
<p>Some trade-offs Cario considers are whether you want to show the big picture idea of the data or the details; show the
parts of a whole to compare them or the individual parts of the whole; show two sets of data or the difference between them;
display accurate information or mislead your audience (not that you should consider intentionally misleading your audience, 
but rather ensuring that the way you visualize your data will not mislead your audience); and whether you want to show that 
the bulk of your data contains values in a similar range or show the highs and lows of this range. Cario also considers who 
the audience is, such as a certain age group, as this may effect how they estimate the data and the truthfulness it will 
convey.

<h3>Some Examples of Ways to Encode Data for Visualization</h3>

<p>This pie chart helps to visualize the data as parts of a whole. The whole being the bag of M&Ms and the slices being the 
colors of the M&Ms.

<br />
<p>The two bar graphs help to visualize the data as individual pieces of data. The first one (pictured on the left above) shows 
the colors in no particular order. The second one (picture on the right above) shows the colors in ascending order to further 
convey which colors are more prominent in a bag of M&Ms.</p>
